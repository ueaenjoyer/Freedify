---

## 🔑 Google Cloud Setup (Required for Drive Sync & AI)

To enable **Google Drive Sync** and **AI features (Smart Playlist, AI Radio, DJ Mode)**, you need to set up a Google Cloud Project.

### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click the project dropdown (top-left) → **New Project**
3. Name it (e.g., "Freedify") → **Create**
4. Select your new project from the dropdown

### Step 2: Enable Required APIs

1. Go to **APIs & Services → Library**
2. Search for and **Enable** each of these:
   - **Google Drive API** (for cloud sync)
   - **Generative Language API** (for Gemini AI features)

### Step 3: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials (for Drive Sign-In)

1. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**
2. Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS → OAuth client ID**
3. If prompted, configure the **OAuth consent screen**:
   - Choose **External** (unless you're a Google Workspace user)
   - Fill in App name, support email
   - Add **Scopes**: `../auth/drive.appdata`, `../auth/drive.file`
   - Add your email as a **Test User** (required during testing)
   - Save and continue
4. Back in Credentials, create an **OAuth client ID**:
   - Application type: **Web application**
   - Name: "Freedify Web"
   - **Authorized JavaScript origins**: Add your domains, e.g.:
     - `http://localhost:8000` (for local dev)
     - `https://your-app.up.railway.app` (for production)
   - **Authorized redirect URIs**: (optional, not needed for implicit flow)
   - Click **Create**
5. Copy your **Client ID** (looks like `123456789-abc.apps.googleusercontent.com`)
6. Set it as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable

### Step 4: Create a Gemini API Key (for AI Features)

1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**
2. Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS → API key**
3. Copy the generated API key
4. (Optional) Click **Edit API key** to restrict it to "Generative Language API" only
5. Set it as `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable

### Environment Variables Summary

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth2 Client ID for Google Sign-In (Drive Sync) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | API Key for Gemini AI (Smart Playlist, AI Radio, DJ Mode) |

> **Note:** For local development on `localhost`, you may see a "This app isn't verified" warning during sign-in. Click **Advanced → Go to Freedify (unsafe)** to proceed. For production, submit your app for verification in the OAuth consent screen settings.

## ☁️ Supabase Cloud Sync Setup

Supabase cloud sync lets users create accounts and automatically sync their library, playlists, history, and settings across any device — including the Android Auto companion app. The free Supabase tier supports thousands of users within its 500 MB limit.

### Step 1: Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a free account
2. Create a new project and note the **Project URL** and **Service Role Key** (found under Project Settings → API)

### Step 2: Run the Database Schema

In the Supabase **SQL Editor**, click **+** and run:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_sync_data (
    user_id     UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    data_key    TEXT NOT NULL,
    data_value  JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    updated_at  TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, data_key)
);

ALTER TABLE user_sync_data ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own data"
    ON user_sync_data FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file (or Render/Railway dashboard):

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJ...your-service-role-key...
```

> **Note:** Use the **Service Role** key (not the anon key). The server proxies all Supabase calls — the key is never exposed to the browser.

### Step 4: Restart and Sign Up

Restart the Freedify server. Open Settings → Cloud Sync, enter an email and password, and click **Sign Up**. Your data will be pushed to Supabase automatically.

---

### 📱 Mobile Ready
- **PWA Support** - Install on your phone's home screen
- **Responsive Design** - Works on any screen size
- **Lossless on the Go** - Streams pure FLAC by default (podcasts/live archives fall back to MP3)
- **Lock Screen Controls** - Play/pause/skip from lock screen (*Note: Chrome on Android provides the best compatibility for lock screen and headphone controls*)

## 🚀 Deployment Guide
Below are the 5 main ways to deploy Freedify, ordered by preference.

### 1. 💻 Localhost (Your Computer)
Best for: Fastest performance, testing, and zero cost.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r app/requirements.txt

# Install FFmpeg (required for transcoding podcasts/lossy audio)
# Windows: winget install ffmpeg
# macOS: brew install ffmpeg
# Linux: apt install ffmpeg

# Run the server
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000
```
Open http://localhost:8000

---

### 2. 🐳 Docker (Recommended for NAS/Local Servers)
Best for: Always-on home servers, Raspberry Pi, unRAID, or running Freedify cleanly in an isolated container.

1. **Install Docker** on your machine.
2. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BioHapHazard/Freedify
   cd Freedify
   ```
3. **Configure:** Open `docker-compose.yml` and add your optional keys (ListenBrainz, Ticketmaster, etc.) in the `environment` section.
4. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
5. **Access:** Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

---

### 3. ☁️ Render (Recommended Free Cloud Host)
Best for: Running a 24/7 public instance of Freedify for yourself with zero costs. Render fully supports our new Tidal Hi-Res API proxy mesh.

1. Fork/push this repo to your own GitHub account.
2. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) → New Web Service.
3. Connect your GitHub repo.
4. Render auto-detects `render.yaml`.
5. Click **Deploy**.

---

### 4. 🚂 Railway (Premium Cloud Host)
Best for: Running a 24/7 public instance of Freedify if you're willing to pay a few dollars a month for slightly faster spin-up times than Render's free tier.

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) → New Project
2. Deploy from GitHub repo
3. Add environment variables (see below)
4. Go to Settings → Networking → Generate Domain
5. Your app will be live at `your-app.up.railway.app`

> **Pricing:** Railway offers a 30-day trial with $5 credit. After that, the Hobby plan is **$5/month**. 

---

### 5. 📱 Termux (Android Native Environment)
Freedify can run directly on an Android device without rooting, using [Termux](https://termux.dev/):

1. Install [Termux](https://termux.dev/) from F-Droid
2. Install system dependencies:
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install python ffmpeg git rust binutils-is-llvm libuv python-cryptography python-grpcio
```
3. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install pydantic_core
```
4. Clone and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BioHapHazard/Freedify
cd Freedify
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
nano .env # (Optional) add your API keys here
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
*(Tip: On Termux, the cache defaults to `~/.freedify_cache` to avoid permission errors. To update in the future, just run `git pull --rebase --autostash` inside the folder)*

## ⚙️ Environment Variables (Deployment Secrets)
