## 🔑 Google Cloud Setup (Required for Drive Sync & AI)

To enable **Google Drive Sync** and **AI features (Smart Playlist, AI Radio, DJ Mode)**, you need to set up a Google Cloud Project.

### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click the project dropdown (top-left) → **New Project**
3. Name it (e.g., "Freedify") → **Create**
4. Select your new project from the dropdown

### Step 2: Enable Required APIs

1. Go to **APIs & Services → Library**
2. Search for and **Enable** each of these:
   - **Google Drive API** (for cloud sync)
   - **Generative Language API** (for Gemini AI features)

### Step 3: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials (for Drive Sign-In)

1. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**
2. Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS → OAuth client ID**
3. If prompted, configure the **OAuth consent screen**:
   - Choose **External** (unless you're a Google Workspace user)
   - Fill in App name, support email
   - Add **Scopes**: `../auth/drive.appdata`, `../auth/drive.file`
   - Add your email as a **Test User** (required during testing)
   - Save and continue
4. Back in Credentials, create an **OAuth client ID**:
   - Application type: **Web application**
   - Name: "Freedify Web"
   - **Authorized JavaScript origins**: Add your domains, e.g.:
     - `http://localhost:8000` (for local dev)
     - `https://your-app.up.railway.app` (for production)
   - **Authorized redirect URIs**: (optional, not needed for implicit flow)
   - Click **Create**
5. Copy your **Client ID** (looks like `123456789-abc.apps.googleusercontent.com`)
6. Set it as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable

### Step 4: Create a Gemini API Key (for AI Features)

1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**
2. Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS → API key**
3. Copy the generated API key
4. (Optional) Click **Edit API key** to restrict it to "Generative Language API" only
5. Set it as `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable

### Environment Variables Summary

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth2 Client ID for Google Sign-In (Drive Sync) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | API Key for Gemini AI (Smart Playlist, AI Radio, DJ Mode) |

> **Note:** For local development on `localhost`, you may see a "This app isn't verified" warning during sign-in. Click **Advanced → Go to Freedify (unsafe)** to proceed. For production, submit your app for verification in the OAuth consent screen settings.

### 📱 Mobile Ready

---

## 📱 Running on Termux (Android)

Freedify can run directly on Android using [Termux](https://termux.dev/):

1. Install [Termux](https://termux.dev/) from F-Droid
2. Install system dependencies:
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install python ffmpeg git rust binutils-is-llvm libuv python-cryptography python-grpcio
```
3. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install pydantic_core
```
4. Clone and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BioHapHazard/Freedify
cd Freedify
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
nano .env # (Optional) add your API keys here
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
*(Tip: On Termux, the cache defaults to `~/.freedify_cache` to avoid permission errors. To update in the future, just run `git pull --rebase --autostash` inside the folder)*


## 🐳 Self-Hosting with Docker (Recommended for NAS/Local Servers)

1. **Install Docker** on your machine.
2. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BioHapHazard/Freedify
   cd Freedify
   ```

## 🌐 Deploy to Railway (Recommended for Mobile + Hi-Res)

**Railway is recommended** for mobile users who want Hi-Res (24-bit) streaming. Docker self-hosting is great for local networks, but Railway gives you a public URL for accessing your music from anywhere.

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) → New Project
2. Deploy from GitHub repo
3. Add environment variables (see below)
4. Go to Settings → Networking → Generate Domain
5. Your app will be live at `your-app.up.railway.app`

> **Pricing:** Railway offers a 30-day trial with $5 credit. After that, the Hobby plan is **$5/month**. If you want free hosting (with 16-bit FLAC only), use Render instead.

---

## 🌐 Deploy to Render (16-bit only)

Render works but **Hi-Res (24-bit) streaming is not available** due to IP restrictions on Dab Music API. You'll still get 16-bit FLAC from Tidal.

1. Fork/push this repo to GitHub
2. Go to render.com → New Web Service
3. Connect your GitHub repo
4. Render auto-detects render.yaml
5. Click Deploy

---
